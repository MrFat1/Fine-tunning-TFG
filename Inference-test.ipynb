However, it's essential to note that this symptom is not typically a sign of embryo failure.\n",

You may be having a pelvic inflammatory disease, and that may be causing the symptoms.

      " Hi. Thanks for using Chat Doctor. I have gone through your query and can understand your concern. Itching between legs and testicles is a common problem, especially in males. This is due to fungal infection like candidiasis or dermatitis. Fungal infection can be caused by the skin contact with fungus. In this condition, skin becomes black and dry, and itching is severe. Itching can be controlled by using antifungal cream containing clotrimazole or miconazole. You can use clotrimazole cream 1% BID for 2 weeks. If you are allergic to clotrimazole, then you can use miconazole cream 2% BID for 2 weeks. You can also use oral antifungal like fluconazole 150 mg OD for 2 weeks. Hope this helps. Take care.

      "Trichomoniasis is a common parasitic infection caused by Trichomonas vaginalis, a protozoan parasite. It is spread through sexual contact and can infect both men and women. The symptoms of trichomoniasis vary depending on the individual and the stage of infection. In women, the infection can cause: 1. Thick, yellowish-green vaginal discharge that may be frothy and have a strong odor. 2. Itching of the genital area. 3. Pain during urination. 4. Painful sexual intercourse. In men, trichomoniasis usually causes no symptoms. However, in rare cases, it can cause: 1. Thick, yellowish-green urethral discharge. 2. Pain during urination. Trichomoniasis can be treated with antibiotics. In women, the infection is usually treated with metronidazole, and in men, it is usually treated with tinidazole. In pregnant women, the infection is usually treated with metronidazole. Trichomoniasis is a common infection and is often asymptomatic. However, if left untreated, it can lead to complications such as pelvic inflammatory disease and infertility. So, it is essential to consult a doctor if you have symptoms of trichomoniasis.

      "Hi, Thanks for choosing Chat Doctor. It is safe to travel pregnant, but it is always advisable to avoid traveling during the first trimester. If you are already pregnant, then you should avoid traveling to areas with high altitude, high temperature, and high humidity. These areas can cause dehydration, which may lead to pregnancy complications. If you have to travel, then you should take necessary precautions such as taking multivitamin, wearing comfortable clothes, and taking regular breaks. Hope this helps. Take care.
